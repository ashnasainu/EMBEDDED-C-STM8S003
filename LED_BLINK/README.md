# STM8S – LED Blinking on All GPIO Pins

This project blinks LEDs connected to all GPIO pins (Ports A, B, C, and D) of the STM8S103F3P6TR.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Sets all GPIO pins as output
- Toggles all pins in a loop
- Adds a simple delay between toggles

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- STM8S103F3P6TR  
- ST Visual Develop (STVD)  
- Cosmic C Compiler  
- ST-Link V2 Programmer  

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the code in **STVD**
2. Build using **Cosmic C**
3. Flash the code using **ST-Link V2**
4. Power the board – all pins will blink

> 💡 Connect LEDs with resistors to see the blinking.
