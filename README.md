# STM8S-C-Projects

This repository contains simple Embedded C programs for the STM8S microcontroller.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- ST Visual Develop (STVD)
- Cosmic C Compiler
- STM8S003F3P6TR
- ST-Link V2 Programmer

## Programs

- **LED_BLINK** - Implementation of LED blinking by toggling all GPIO pins (Ports A, B, C, and D) using the STM8S103F3P6TR microcontroller.

- **HELLO_WORLD** â€“ Implementation of 16x2 character LCD interfacing with STM8S103F3P6TR using 4-bit mode. The LCD is connected to GPIO pins across Ports B and C, and displays the message "HELLO WORLD" on startup.

- **RELAY ON , OFF & BLINK**-   Implementation of a relay ON, OFF & blink with STM8S103F3P6TR microcontroller (pin PA2).  
The relay can be turned ON, OFF, or blinked with a delay.



## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open project in STVD.
2. Compile using Cosmic C.
3. Flash the code using ST-Link.
4. Power the board and see the output.
